## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to Git (already in .gitignore)

## How It Works

1. **LocalWP** provides a complete local WordPress environment
2. **Export script** packages your site files and database
3. **FTP deployment** uploads everything to InfinityFree
4. **Automated setup** handles database import and URL updates
5. **Free hosting** gives you a production site at zero cost

From local development to live production in minutes - completely free!

## InfinityFree Limitations (Free Plan)

- No email sending (use SMTP plugin with Gmail/SendGrid)
- Daily hits limit (check InfinityFree documentation)
- No SSH access (use FTP for file management)
- PhpMyAdmin for database management
- Cannot use some WordPress plugins that require specific PHP extensions

## Upgrading to Paid Hosting

When your site grows, you can:
1. Export your site from InfinityFree
2. Import to any paid hosting (SiteGround, Cloudways, etc.)
3. Update DNS to point to new host
4. Continue using this workflow for development

## Troubleshooting

### LocalWP Issues

```bash
# Site not starting
- Check LocalWP logs: Right-click site > View Logs
- Restart site: Stop and Start
- Restart LocalWP application

# Database connection error
- Verify site is running in LocalWP
- Check database credentials in wp-config.php
```

### InfinityFree Issues

```bash
# FTP connection failed
- Verify credentials in .env
- Check InfinityFree control panel for FTP status
- Try connecting with FileZilla to verify credentials

# Site showing errors
- Check PHP error logs in InfinityFree control panel
- Verify database was imported successfully
- Check file permissions (should be 644 for files, 755 for folders)

# URLs not working
- Verify .htaccess was uploaded
- Check permalink settings in WordPress admin
- Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes"
```
