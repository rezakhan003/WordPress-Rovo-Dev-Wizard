# WordPress Rovo Dev Wizard - Complete Workflow & Development Guide

## üö® MANDATORY: ONE-SHOT COMPLETE EXECUTION

**YOU MUST COMPLETE THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW IN ONE SHOT. DO NOT STOP PARTWAY.**
**DO NOT deliver partial work. DO NOT stop after Phase 1. DO NOT skip steps.**
**COMPLETE MEANS: Research ‚Üí Build Website ‚Üí Test Locally ‚Üí Fix ALL issues ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Deploy**
**The website must be FULLY FUNCTIONAL in LocalWP before you stop.**

**DO NOT REPORT BACK TO THE USER OR ASK THEM ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HAVE:**
- A fully built website running in LocalWP
- All directory entries created and populated
- All taxonomy pages working
- Navigation menus fully populated
- ZERO 404 errors verified by testing
- Exported package ready for deployment
- Deployed to InfinityFree (if credentials provided)

**The user hired you to BUILD A WEBSITE, not to show research or ask questions.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ZERO 404 ERRORS

**EVERY website you build MUST have ZERO 404 errors. Test EVERY SINGLE link.**
**Headers and footers ALWAYS have broken links if you don't check them systematically.**
**Do not deliver a website until you've verified every link works.**

## üéØ Main Workflow Process - COMPLETE ALL PHASES

When building a directory website, you MUST complete ALL phases in one continuous workflow:

### Phase 1: Deep Research & Comprehensive Data Collection

**GOAL: Create pages so information-rich that visitors never need to leave your site**

1. **Research each individual entry exhaustively using Jina AI**
   - Scrape the company's main website completely
   - Find and scrape their pricing pages, feature lists, documentation
   - Search for reviews, comparisons, alternatives
   - Gather technical specifications, integrations, use cases
   - Find case studies, success stories, testimonials
   - Collect founder information, company history, funding details
   - Get support options, contact methods, social media links
   - Retry any failed scrapes until you have EVERYTHING

2. **Build massive JSON datasets for each entry**
   Each individual page JSON should contain:
   ```json
   {
     "basics": {
       "name", "tagline", "description" (500+ words),
       "founded", "headquarters", "employees", "funding"
     },
     "detailed_features": [
       {"name", "description" (100+ words), "category", "importance"}
     ],
     "pricing": {
       "model", "free_tier", "starter_price", "tiers": [
         {"name", "price", "features" (20+), "limits", "best_for"}
       ]
     },
     "use_cases": [
       {"title", "description" (200+ words), "industry", "company_size"}
     ],
     "pros_cons": {
       "pros": [{"title", "explanation" (50+ words)}],
       "cons": [{"title", "explanation" (50+ words)}]
     },
     "integrations": [
       {"name", "type", "description", "documentation_url"}
     ],
     "alternatives": [
       {"name", "comparison" (100+ words), "when_to_choose"}
     ],
     "reviews": {
       "average_rating", "total_reviews",
       "rating_breakdown": {"5": %, "4": %, "3": %, "2": %, "1": %},
       "expert_reviews": [{"source", "rating", "summary" (200+ words)}]
     },
     "technical_specs": {
       "platforms", "languages", "api", "security", "compliance"
     },
     "support": {
       "channels", "response_time", "documentation_quality", "community"
     },
     "media": {
       "logo", "screenshots" (10+), "videos", "diagrams"

### Phase 2.5: MANDATORY Link Verification - CHECK EVERY SINGLE LINK

**‚õî STOP! DO NOT SKIP THIS! YOU MUST CHECK EVERY SINGLE LINK!**

**THE WEBSITE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL EVERY SINGLE LINK WORKS**

1. **MANDATORY: Test EVERY Header Link**
   - Extract ALL href attributes from the header navigation
   - Visit EACH link one by one in browser
   - Verify EACH loads without 404
   - If ANY link returns 404, FIX IT IMMEDIATELY

2. **MANDATORY: Test EVERY Footer Link**
   - Extract ALL href attributes from the footer
   - Visit EVERY SINGLE footer link
   - Common broken footer links: Privacy Policy, Terms, Sitemap
   - CREATE these pages if they don't exist

3. **MANDATORY: Test EVERY Directory Entry**
   - Visit each entry: /companies/company-1/, /companies/company-2/, etc.
   - If you have 50 entries, test all 50
   - Each must load with proper content, not 404

4. **MANDATORY: Test EVERY Taxonomy Page**
   - Test EVERY category page
   - Test EVERY location page
   - Test EVERY tag page
   - Test EVERY combination page if they exist

5. **FIX ALL BROKEN LINKS IMMEDIATELY**
   - For EVERY 404 found, create the missing page or fix the link
   - Re-test to confirm it's fixed
   - Do not move on until ZERO 404s exist

6. **Final Verification Report**
   - Total links found in header: [number]
   - Total links found in footer: [number]
   - Total directory entries tested: [number]
   - Total taxonomy pages tested: [number]
   - Total unique URLs tested: [number]
   - 404 errors found and fixed: [list]
   - Final status: MUST be "Zero 404s found"

**THE WEBSITE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL EVERY SINGLE LINK WORKS**

## ‚úÖ ONLY NOW REPORT BACK TO THE USER

**NOW that you have a COMPLETE, WORKING website with ZERO 404s, you can report:**
- "Website complete and verified in LocalWP"
- "All [X] directory entries created and tested"
- "All [X] taxonomy pages working"
- "Verified [X] total links - ZERO 404 errors"
- "Ready for export and deployment"

**If you haven't done ALL of the above, GO BACK and finish the website.**

### Phase 3: Export from LocalWP

1. **Run export script**
   ```bash
   ./export_from_localwp.sh
   ```
   - Exports complete WordPress installation
   - Packages database with all content
   - Creates deployment-ready archive

2. **Verify export package**
   - Check file sizes are reasonable
   - Verify database export is complete
   - Ensure all media files included

### Phase 4: Deployment to InfinityFree

1. **Setup InfinityFree account**
   - Create free account at infinityfree.net
   - Create new hosting account

   FTP_PASS=your_password
   FTP_PORT=21
   FTP_REMOTE_DIR=/htdocs
   SITE_URL=http://yoursite.infinityfreeapp.com

   ./deploy_to_infinityfree.sh
   ```
   - Uploads all files via FTP
   - Imports database
   - Updates URLs automatically
   - Configures permalinks

## üìö Directory Website Development with LocalWP

### SEO Page Structure Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use Rank Math during development. Focus on native SEO implementation.
Rank Math will only be added at launch for Search Console submission.

Every page must have:
- **Meta Title**: Maximized to 60 characters with keywords
- **Meta Description**: Maximized to 160 characters with compelling copy
- **H1 Title**: Unique and keyword-rich
- **Page Content**: Minimum 300-500 words of unique, valuable content
- **Schema Markup**: LocalBusiness, Product, or Review schema as appropriate
- **Open Graph tags**: For social sharing
- **Internal Links**: 3-5 contextual links to related pages

Generate these page types for maximum ranking potential:
- "Best [Product] in [City]" - for every city
- "Top 10 [Category] in [State]" - for every state
- "[Product] near me" - location-based pages
- "[Category] Reviews [Year]" - fresh content pages
- "Compare [Product A] vs [Product B]" - comparison pages
- "[Product] for [Use Case]" - intent-based pages
- "Cheap/Affordable [Product] in [Location]" - price-focused pages

### Review System Framework

Frame reviews contextually based on the directory type:
- For restaurants: "[Cuisine] lovers who dined at [Restaurant] can leave a review"
- For products: "[Product] users who tried [Brand] can share their experience"
- For services: "Customers who used [Service] from [Company] can rate their experience"
- For venues: "Visitors who went to [Venue] can share their thoughts"

Review form should include:
- Overall star rating (1-5 stars)
- Category-specific ratings (e.g., Quality, Service, Value, Location)
- Written review with minimum 50 characters
- Photo upload option
- "Would you recommend?" Yes/No
- Verified purchase/visit checkbox
- Helpful/Not Helpful voting on other reviews

### Research Phase with Jina AI

When building directory websites, use Jina AI for comprehensive research:

```bash
# Search for information (use s.jina.ai)
curl "https://s.jina.ai/?q=YOUR_SEARCH_TERM" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"

# Scrape individual pages (use r.jina.ai)
curl "https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com/page" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"
```

**Important Research Guidelines:**
- Create detailed JSON for each directory page
- If a page 404s or doesn't scrape properly, retry the scrape
- DO NOT use Jina to scrape CSS from design sites

### Finding Royalty-Free Images

```bash
# Search for Unsplash images using Jina
curl "https://s.jina.ai/?q=YOUR_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION+unsplash" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"

# Then scrape the found Unsplash pages for non-premium images
curl "https://r.jina.ai/https://unsplash.com/photos/..." \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"
```

### Directory Page JSON Format

Each directory entry should have comprehensive data:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Company/Service Name",
  "category": "Technology Category",
  "description": "Detailed description...",
  "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "..."],
  "pricing": {
    "model": "subscription/one-time/freemium",
    "tiers": [...]
  },
  "images": {
    "logo": "url-from-unsplash",
    "screenshots": ["url1", "url2"],
    "hero": "hero-image-url"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "founded": "year",
    "headquarters": "location",
    "employees": "range",
    "funding": "amount"
  },
  "links": {
    "website": "url",
    "documentation": "url",
    "pricing": "url"
  },
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "lastUpdated": "timestamp"
}
```

### CSS Development Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** Create extremely detailed and complex CSS files that are well-thought-out:

- Don't write short, simple CSS - make it comprehensive
- Include detailed animations and transitions
- Add hover states, focus states, and active states
- Create responsive breakpoints for all screen sizes
- Include print styles and accessibility features
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Add detailed comments explaining complex sections
- Implement sophisticated grid and flexbox layouts
- Include fallbacks for older browsers

Example of detailed CSS approach:
```css
/* Component: Directory Card
   Purpose: Display individual directory entries
   States: default, hover, active, disabled, loading
   Breakpoints: mobile-first approach with 5 breakpoints
   Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant */

.directory-card {
  /* Base styles with extensive properties */
  /* Multiple transition effects */
  /* Complex shadow systems */
  /* Detailed spacing scales */
}
```
